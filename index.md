**About Me**  

I am a Software Engineering student working with C programming, HTML, CSS, and Git/GitHub. I plan to use C in operating systems and other low-level software projects, and HTML, CSS to build websites.
I also produce and release original music on Spotify, Apple Music, and other streaming platforms.
